      At Little Kingdom School it is our endeavor to develop 
      deeper into the true purpose of education by giving our 
      students opportunities and an environment that is positive, 
      inspiring, challenging and stimulating. We want each one
      of our students to follow their bliss, blaze new trails
      and open new avenues. Being the pioneer of play nursery
      in Jabalpur, Little Kingdom Senior Secondary School was
      founded in the year 1991 as a crèche that has now proudly
      metamorphosed into one of the premier educational institution
      in the city. Our history, experience and research have 
      endowed us with a better understanding of the way children
      grow, play and imbibe knowledge garnered over a period 
      of nearly three decades daily in all our interactions
      with our students, and in the reviewing and amelioration 
      process of our academic programs.  
      <br><br>
          With a co – educational day boarding pattern the school 
          is affiliated with the CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 
          (CBSE) and currently operates in three branches i.e. 
          Napier town and New Ramnagar Adhartal & Tilhari Mandla Road.

                      Education is not just about the subjects that are learnt and taught in school.
                      Becoming educated is not restricted to being in school and then in college, 
                      gathering certificates and feeling proud of oneself. It is a lifelong exercise
                      that can be unbelievably exciting if only we wish to jump onto the train of 
                      experience and take a trip to every conceivable place on the earth.
                      <br><br>
                  
                     The thirst for knowledge is not restricted to the child. It is also essential 
                     for a parent and a teacher to keep adding to their knowledge bank by keeping
                     their eyes and ears open and by reading as much as possible and ensuring that
                     children develop these habits as well. 
                  
                  
                  <br><br>
                      Besides all of the above, that add to children becoming truly educated, 
                      schools and teachers must ensure that children have a society of
                      enriching experiences. Creativity and imagination make children grow 
                      up to be productive adults who then arrive as citizens of the world 
                      to make their own great contribution to mankind.
                  
                  <br><br>
                      Lets dedicate this year to a correct understanding of what education 
                      really means and let us all benefit from this understanding.

                      The children of today are gearing up to become responsible adults
                      of tomorrow. The growth as parallel to the future of our country
                      reflected through the education imparted to them. Education is the
                      foundation of a society and is responsible for economic,

                      Dear Parents,

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                      On behalf of L.K.S Family, I would like to welcome all to
                      unequalled environment of our school. It is an honor to lead 
                      a professional and dedicated staff. We strive to provide a 
                      rigorous, standard based curriculum focused on students and 
                      their individual needs.
                  
                  <br><br>
                      Education is a partnership between the school and home and 
                      we are fully vested in partnering with the parents to make each
                      child reach his full potential. We focus on creating an 
                      atmosphere where everyone shows respect for differences 
                      in other people, customs and cultures.
                  <br><br>
                      Our educational programs are infused into the curriculum 
                      that focuses on achievement of our goals. I believe that 
                      it is through working together will help us succeed in 
                      bringing the best educational opportunities to each child.
