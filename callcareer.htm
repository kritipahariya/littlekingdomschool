                      The power over a global language is very significant to survive
                      in the rapid advancing world . Communication becomes futile when
                      language becomes a barrier. Our enthusiastic learners get together 
                      to work on to develop their efficiency in the English language 
                      by means of conduction of various activities like Just a minute talk,
                      extempore, debates, spellathons and many more, to enhance the language
                      and vocabulary skills.

                      them to learn and define themselves as an individual.

                      Geography, history and civics are few subjects which many of us didn't 
                      fancy studying but think  how imprudent would it seem to visit a new 
                      place without having no knowledge about it or to question the rules 
                      and policies of a country without being aware of its formation.
                      In this club, our learners come together and participate in activities
                      related to the historical events or demographics of a place or the
                      constitutional events of a country by way of virtual tours over the 
                      gadgets or by forming an unreal parliament and describe its functions.
                      This makes the students fascinated towards the subject knowledge which
                      appeared dull to them and also such exposure helps in developing wise

                     Having an Art Club is a great way for students to be involved in art .
                     When our time with them is limited in the classroom, an art club can 
                     serve as a nice supplement for students who can’t get enough art.
